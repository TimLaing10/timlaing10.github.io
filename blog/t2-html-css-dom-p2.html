        <h3> Grid based design </h3>
          <p> Grid based design is a way of laying out all the elements on the page by using tows and columns. It allows the developer to lay out the page in a way that correlates with peoples reading habbits and traditional print layout.
          </p>


        <h3>Responsive webpages </h3>
          <p> In the early days of the internet there was really only one way you could use it, on a computer with a regular screen. With new technolgies such as tablets and smartphones you need your website to respond to the size of screen that the user has, hence responsive design. This means that your site needs to be dynamic to allow it to function in multiple sized browsers and resolutions.
          </p>

        <h3>Sematic structure</h3>
          <p> Semantic elements are elements with meaning. Semantic structure means defining certain elements and how you want them to display in a hierachy. I.e an H1 tag is the main heading whereas a H2 tag is a secondary heading. It defines the meaning to the browser and the developer.
          </p>

        <h3> Other points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I was interested in the text overflow function</li>
          <li>Media queries to change css properties based on device, screensize and colour</li>
          <li>The use of negative space to enhance design</li>
          <li>If you have had an issue it is likely that someone else has before as well so try searchng the web for an answer</li>
        </ul>
