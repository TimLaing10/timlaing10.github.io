      <h3> Emotional intelligence</h3>
  <p>
    The importance of emotional intelligence has always been clear, but that does not mean I have been a good practitioner of it. I found it particularly enlightening how the co-release of emotion in the body is a lot more vivib than in the mind. If one can learn to understand the feelings in the body then they can understand feelings as they are arising and deal with them before they are too late, for example a flushed face when you are starting to feel angry.
 </p>
  <p>
    It is also really good to know that emotional skills are trainable and we are not stuck being the way we are now. If we can develop these skills we can better deal with challenges and then develop self confidence. Starting with mindfulness seems like an excellent way to do this. I think patience with others is a real weakness for me so identifying those feelings will be a great help.

    When I tried mindfulness I found it was a good way to centre myself and draw my attention back to what I was doing. I have a real habbit of wandering in my mind so I think this will be a valuable technique for me.
