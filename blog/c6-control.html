              <p>When I am programming I can find myself getting quite despondent if I can't figure something out. I sometimes notice that I can get stuck in a thought that I am not computer savvy enough to be able to complete this course. I find that talking with other students helps me realise that it is a process and everyone has difficulties.</p>

                  <p>I found the Siberian method very interesting. Since I have read about it I have tried to practice it several times. I think my wife finds it quite strange when I stop and start taking breaths instead of arguing back. I think it will require a lot of practice but it is great to notice the anger building up and choosing not to act on it. It then dissipates very quickly</p>
