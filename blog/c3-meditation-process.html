                  Coming from a background in woodworking I have found it hard to accept the process over product mantra. However as I have started using timeblocking and it has made it easier to leave something even though it is far from perfect. I know that it will all come together at some point and I am not a professional web developer so I need to just keep rolling and keep things in perspective.

                      I had tried meditation before and wasn't really sure what was about and what I was supposed to be doing. I also thought that I wasn't very good at it as I was easily distracted. I had started <em>Headspace</em>, an online tool recently so I was getting a better grip of what mindfulness and meditation were.
