                  There have been a number of times that I have become blocked on a simple problem. Often this problem is where I have accidentally added a extra brackets or closing arrow where it is not needed when trying to write JavaScript.
                  <br>
                  I would have to comb through the code and try and find the errors then refresh the page and hope that it worked. This can be a frustrating process. However I have talked to some of my classmates and they recommended going through the code and checking each function worked. Using Dev tools seems like this will be an excellent way to do this.

                      <strong>Pseudocode -</strong> I have just started to write pseudocode and mapping out my code before I write it. I have found that working out the logic first allows me to process what I am trying to achieve, which can be hard just in your mind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <strong>Trying something - </strong> I find that trying something doesn't necessarily work for me as well as mapping it out. When I just try something it seems to end it frustration. Planning appears to be key.

                      <strong>Rubber ducky - </strong> Whaaaaat?

                  <p>
                      <strong>Reading error messages - </strong> This has been super helpful especially in the exercises to see where I have gone wrong. I sometimes have to google the message though to see what it means.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <strong> Console.logging - </strong> My classmates put me onto this as a great way to work through JavaScript line by line to see where the error is. I think I will be able to get a similar result with Dev tools.

                      <strong>Googling - </strong> A man's best friend is not his dog, it is Google.

                      <strong>Asking your peers for help - </strong> This was good but as I have fallen a week behind people have moved on so not so helpful. When I was in Wellington with a couple of the team this was very helpful though.

                      <strong>Coaches - </strong> Asking coaches for help is great if you have some code to show them but if you are stumped from the beginning it may be better to ask your peers first.

                  <p>
                      <strong> Reflection -</strong> This is a very valuable tool. Thinking about what has worked and trying to to continue to make the same mistakes can make a real difference.

                      <strong>.map() -</strong> This calls a function on all the elements in an array then creates a new array with the values that have been outputed.

                      <strong>.reduce() -</strong> Applys a function (e.g + -) against an accumulator (from left to right) to reduce the array to a single value.
