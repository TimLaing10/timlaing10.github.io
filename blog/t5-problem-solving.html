                  There have been a number of times that I have become blocked on a simple problem. Often this problem is where I have accidentally added a extra brackets or closing arrow where it is not needed when trying to write JavaScript.
                  <br>
                  I would have to comb through the code and try and find the errors then refresh the page and hope that it worked. This can be a frustrating process. However I have talked to some of my classmates and they recommended going through the code and checking each function worked. Using Dev tools seems like this will be an excellent way to do this.
