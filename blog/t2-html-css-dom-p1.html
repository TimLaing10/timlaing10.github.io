        <h3> HTML, CSS and DOM </h3>
        <p> HTML is the framework of a site. You can think of it like a tree with branches off of it which are called tags. You give each branch a tag and that tells it what the branch will be like. Because you have so many branches on the tree and many of them will have similar attributes we use something called CSS which stands for cascading style sheets. These sheets are a reference for the branch to talk to tell it how it should look and act, for example which colour leaves it should have, is it a thick or thin branch or is in bent.
