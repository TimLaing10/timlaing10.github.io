        <h3> HTML, CSS and the DOM </h3>
        <p> HTML is the framework of a site. You can think of it like a tree with branches off of it which are called tags. You give each branch a tag and that tells it what the branch will be like. Because you have so many branches on the tree and many of them will have similar attributes we use something called CSS which stands for cascading style sheets. These sheets are a reference for the branch to talk to tell it how it should look and act, for example which colour leaves it should have, is it a thick or thin branch or is in bent.

        Carrying on from this the DOM or Document Object Model is a cross platform application programming interface which treats the language you have used i.e XML or HTML like a tree.

        <h3> Boxifying design </h3>
        <p> Boxifying design is taking a design and breaking it down into boxes, all the way down to the smallest element. As web pages are made up completely of boxes this is the best way to take something visual and put it into code.
        </p>

        <h3> The box model</h3>
        <p> As discussed above all HTML elements can be seens as boxes. The box model is used when working on design and layout and wraps around every html element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
        </p>
