  The EDA/DBC experience is both scary and exciting. I know that the more prep I can do now will assist me when I get to the bootcamp section.
  Watching the video with Shareef was a great way to understand what we are going to be doing but also to change my perceptions of what is important.
  The ability to admit that you don't always know what you are doing is a barrier to break down. I liked how Shareef talked about intelligence and how it is going to be your ability to get on with
  others that will make you a good developer not how smart or fast you are at something. When I previously worked in web there was a feeling that you were stupid if you didn't understand how it all worked.
  I feel like this has made me more optimistic and I am excited about getting together with my cohort to create some cool stuff and support each other.
  It's good that it's not a competitive environment and we will all be helping each other. I am sure there will be plenty of times I find this project hard but I am definitely excited.
