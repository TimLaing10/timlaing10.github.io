  <p>The EDA/DBC experience is both scary and exciting. I know that the more prep I can do now will assist me when I get to the bootcamp section.
  Watching the video with Shareef was a great way to understand what we are going to be doing but also to change my perceptions of what is important.</p>
  <p>The ability to admit that you don't always know what you are doing is a barrier to break down. I liked how Shareef talked about intelligence and how it is going to be your ability to get on with
  others that will make you a good developer not how smart or fast you are at something. When I previously worked in web there was a feeling that you were stupid if you didn't understand how it all worked.</p>
  <p>I feel like this has made me more optimistic and I am excited about getting together with my cohort to create some cool stuff and support each other.
  It's good that it's not a competitive environment and we will all be helping each other. I am sure there will be plenty of times I find this project hard but I am definitely excited.</p>
