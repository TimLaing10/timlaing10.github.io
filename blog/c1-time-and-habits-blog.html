              <h6> Time management</h6>
                  <p>Time management can be a problem area for me as it can for many others. I have found that I am most effective in the morning and try and get most of my work done then. There was a bunch of interesting ideas and blogs in the time management section that I enjoyed reading. </p>
                  <p> I enjoyed the idea of starting to create habits by just doing small things and letting these become the start of something bigger. The Pomodoro technique of working in small measurement time incriments will be a helpful way of doing this. I am really interested in keeping this up. </p>
                  <p> I have tried meditation and mindfulness before and I am keen to give it a go again. I find that as I get older it certainly resonates with me more. When I was younger I tried it and it didn't work at all.</p>
