                I found this very interesting. Pleasure for me has manifested itself in a big way throughout my life, be it through drinking when I was younger to spending lots of money on material items. I have been aware for a while that this is the case but the chapter in search inside yourself put some context around it. These short term pleasures have invariably left me feeling bad and low afterwards and the initial euphoria soon wears off.
                <br />
                The passion stage was something I found when I was woodworking. When I hit that sweet spot nothing could touch me and I would be steaming along. However quite often something would come along and slow the momentum. I found myself buzzing and thinking about it when I wanted to sleep, however the lows when things weren't working could be quite bad.
                <br />
                Working to a higher purpose is something I have thought about a lot. I believe strongly in equality and social justice but my actions don't match my thoughts. I would like to find a job or a hobby where I made a tangeable difference to peoples lives, not just signing online petitions and ignoring the tough stuff. I am working towards a transition from pleasure to purpose and trying to live mindfully and care about what I buy and who I support. Interstingly just writing this was really easy as it's something that has been on my mind.

                        I found the whole resilience exercise very interesting. It know from experience that it is very easy to be elated with wins and crushed with losses. I found the mindfulness very helpful in recognising that this is something I do. By letting good and bad come and go without grasping at them there would not be such highs and such lows and we would be more resiliant to failure. This will have to tie in with the idea of doing something with purpose rather than pleasure.
