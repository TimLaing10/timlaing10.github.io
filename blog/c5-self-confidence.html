              <p>Mindfulness and self awareness are very similar. Mindfulness is the ability to recognise your emotions in a non-judgemental way. Self awareness is much the same and helps you to recognise the emotions you are feeling objectively and from a distance. Recognising the effects of your emotions can allow you to better understand your strengths and limits. This in turn gives you the confidence to be sure of your self-worth and what you are capable of.</p>

              <p>I have been practicing mindfulness since the beginning of the course using an application called Headspace. As the program has developed an exercise of scanning the body has been an effective way to understand what the body is feeling. The SIYS talk helped me to understand that every emotion has a physiological correlate so if you take the time to scan the body and recognise feelings you will gain a greater insight into the emotions you are feeling.</p>

              <p>I found this concept incredibly interesting. Looking at your emotions as something you are experiencing not as who you are allows you to deal with them objectively. The way we tall about emotions is really important too. Learning to say that you are "experiencing something" rather than "you are something" is a tool I am going to pursue.</p>
