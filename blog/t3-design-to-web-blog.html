                <h5>Responsive sites</h5>
                  <p>
                    A responsive site is one that responds to the browser or device it is being viewed on. When smartphones became popular there was a rush to build mobile sites but this proved to be too difficult to maintain two different variants. Responsive sites position what is on the screen according to the screens resolution and can adjust content around the page accordingly.

                <h5>Mobile first</h5>
                  <p>
                    Mobile first essentially means building for mobile phones and then adding media queries to alter elements as the screen resolution grows.

                    It also means designing with mobile data in mind so not including unneccessary content that would be slow to load. You may also identify the content people would be looking for on their mobiles such as contact details and opening hours.

                <h5>Frameworks</h5>
                  <p>
                    Frameworks are preformatted templates that you can use to build a site. It takes away the uneccassary coding of the whole site and css from scratch.

                  <li>There can be a lot of unecessary code to remove</li>
                  <li>Can reduce the amount you actually learn about web development as you just use pre-written templates</li>

                <h5>Wireframes</h5>
                  <p>
                    Wireframes are the blueprint to a website and allow you to fully develop a sites structure. By mapping out the site then everyone working on it can be sure of how it needs to be put together and identify any issues.
                  </p>
                  <figure class="wireframe-img">
                      <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.JPG" alt="Desktop wireframe for index and blog pages." style="width:375px;height:375px;">
                      <figcaption>
                        <em>
                            Wireframe for desktop
                        </em>
                      </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure class="wireframe-img">
                      <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.JPG" alt="Mobile wireframe for index and blog pages." style="width:375px;height:375px;">
                      <figcaption>
                        <em>
                            Wireframe for mobile
                        </em>
                      </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <P>
                        I found the wireframe was pretty good for getting the site to be responsive. I couldn't get the navigation to sit exactly as I wanted and discovered some of the functionality I wanted was javascript so will have to wait to learn that.
