                    A responsive site is one that responds to the browser or device it is being viewed on. When smartphones became popular there was a rush to build mobile sites but this proved to be too difficult to maintain two different variants. Responsive sites position what is on the screen according to the screens resolution and can adjust content around the page accordingly.

                <h5>Mobile first</h5>
                  <p>
                    Mobile first essentially means building for mobile phones and then adding media queries to alter elements as the screen resolution grows.

                    It also means designing with mobile data in mind so not including unneccessary content that would be slow to load. You may also identify the content people would be looking for on their mobiles such as contact details and opening hours.
